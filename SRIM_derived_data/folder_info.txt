This folder should contain definitions of class Minerals, and definitions of specific objects, say, Olivine.
And they should be in seperate files. minerals.py should only contain definition of the general class. 
Another file should be created to contain all objects defined under Minerals.

__init__.py should import minerals.py so that main always have access to the class Minerals
