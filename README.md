Minerals deep underground can be used to look for traces of dark matter-induced nuclear recoil damage tracks in the mineral lattice. This code calculates the expected number of tracks and their track lengths due nuclear recoil from various sources, including neutrinos, neutrons from radioactive decays and dark matter particles.
