Minerals deep underground can be used to look for traces of nuclear recoil damage tracks in the mineral lattice. This code calculates the track length distribution due nuclear recoil from various sources, including neutrinos, neutrons from radioactive decays and dark matter particles etc. For more details please read https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08885

This code combines results from TRIM (Transport of Ion in Matter) simulations (datasets are now available at https://zenodo.org/records/15358408) and analytical modelling of incoming fluxes of particles calibrated by observations to model the differential rate as a function of track length.
